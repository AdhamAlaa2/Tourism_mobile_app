I developed an app for Tourists in Egypt. Users can either create a post about a location such 
as museum, restaurant, beach, club,,… with image(s), descriptions and recommendations.  
• People are allowed to add their own comments on the post and they can rate it as well.   
• You can also categorize the posts into different categories. You need to be logged in to post and comment 
and rate. 
• Not-logged users can still browse, search and read everything about the posts. 
My application features: - 
User accounts and authentications - - - - - - - 
Several screens with navigations (bottom, tabs, drawers…. Not necessarily all of them.) 
Online Database (Firebase) 
Push notifications 
Error handling (connection issues, wrong inputs…)
